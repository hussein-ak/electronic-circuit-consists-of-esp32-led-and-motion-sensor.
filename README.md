## Simple explaination of the project
I developed an electronic system utilizing an ESP32 microcontroller, integrated with an LED and a motion sensor. The system is designed to function as follows:

1. Motion Detection: When the sensor detects movement in its vicinity, it triggers the system.
2. Automatic Illumination: Upon detecting motion, the LED automatically turns on, providing illumination.
3. Energy Efficiency: In the absence of motion, the LED remains off to conserve energy.
4. Real-time Response: The system continuously monitors for motion, ensuring immediate response to environmental changes.

This setup creates an intelligent, energy-efficient lighting solution that responds dynamically to human presence, ideal for applications such as smart home lighting or security systems.
